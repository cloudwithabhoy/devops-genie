# Git Project Ideas

> Hands-on projects to build real Git skills.

## Beginner

- **Practice Repo** — Create a repo, make commits, create branches, merge, and resolve a deliberate merge conflict.
- **Commit History Cleanup** — Use interactive rebase to squash, reorder, and reword commits on a feature branch.

## Intermediate

<!-- Add intermediate project ideas here -->

- **Git Hooks** — Write a `pre-commit` hook that runs linting and blocks commits with failing lint; add a `commit-msg` hook enforcing Conventional Commits format.
- **Git Aliases** — Configure a set of useful git aliases (e.g., `git lg` for a pretty log graph) in `.gitconfig`.
- **Branching Strategy Lab** — Simulate a Git Flow workflow with feature, release, and hotfix branches on a sample project.

## Advanced

<!-- Add advanced project ideas here -->

- **Monorepo Setup** — Set up a monorepo with Nx or Turborepo; configure affected-only CI using `git diff`.
- **Release Automation** — Use semantic-release or release-please to automate versioning and changelog generation from Conventional Commits.
- **Bisect Lab** — Introduce a bug in commit history, then use `git bisect` to identify the exact offending commit.

## Project Template

For each project, document:
1. **Goal** — What Git skill you're practising
2. **Steps** — Exact commands and workflow
3. **Key Concepts** — Git features demonstrated
4. **Gotchas** — Common mistakes and how to avoid them
