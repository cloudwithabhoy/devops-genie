# Networking Project Ideas

> Hands-on projects to build real networking skills.

## Beginner

- **Home Network Diagram** — Map your home network topology, identify all devices, IP ranges, and gateway.
- **DNS Resolver Lab** — Use `dig` and `nslookup` to trace DNS resolution for several domains.

## Intermediate

<!-- Add intermediate project ideas here -->

- **Set Up a Local DNS Server** — Run Pi-hole or BIND9 on a VM to serve as a local DNS resolver.
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy** — Configure Nginx to reverse-proxy multiple backend services.
- **Firewall Rules Lab** — Configure `iptables` or `nftables` rules to allow/deny specific traffic.

## Advanced

<!-- Add advanced project ideas here -->

- **VPN Server** — Set up a WireGuard or OpenVPN server on a cloud VM.
- **Network Packet Analyser** — Use `tcpdump` or Wireshark to capture and analyse HTTP/DNS traffic.
- **BGP Simulation** — Use GNS3 or EVE-NG to simulate a multi-router BGP topology.

## Project Template

For each project, document:
1. **Goal** — What you're building and why
2. **Prerequisites** — Required tools and knowledge
3. **Architecture** — Network diagram or description
4. **Steps** — Step-by-step guide
5. **Verification** — How to test that it works
